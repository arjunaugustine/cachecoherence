Report Project 2
Many of you have raised a concern about the project spec being unclear about what has to be included in the report. Here is what you should include in the report:
With the configurations mentioned in the spec:
1. Cache performance (use only Long trace):
  a. Plot a graph showing the trend for miss rate vs cache size (assoc and block size constant) for each protocol.
  b. Plot a graph showing the trend for miss rate vs cache block size (assoc and cache size constant) for each protocol.
  c. Plot a graph showing the trend for number of memory transactions vs cache size (assoc and block size constant) for each protocol.
  d. Plot a graph showing the trend for number of memory transactions vs cache block size (assoc and cache size constant) for each protocol.
 
Analysis: Discuss the various aspects of the coherence protocols- number of memory transactions, complexity of the protocols and how the performance is impacted. As you vary the configuration, discuss the trends within a system and across protocol.   
 
2. Bus Transactions: Out of the listed Metrics, only report numbers from 17 (cache to cache transfers) to 23 (busUpgrs). Use only Long trace.
   Analysis: Discuss the trend about bus traffic. For various configurations, discuss the trend across protocols.
  Report these metrics for the experiments you do for generating the graphs, no other additional experiments are needed.
